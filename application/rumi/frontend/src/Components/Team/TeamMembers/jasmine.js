                    Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jasmine, a software engineering & math student at SFSU passionate about technology driven
                    change.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As a technologist, I'm fueled by an affinity for learning and a conviction that technology is here to serve
                    people, not manipulate them nor monotize their attention. I'm driven to building products and designing
                    solutions that serve people and communitites on a global scale. <br />
                    <br />
                    I'm constantly intrested in new ideas and looking for ways I could be helpful. Currently, I'm reading
                    <em> Give & Take</em>, <em>Atomic Habits</em>, and <em>the War of Art</em>. Say hello at anytime
                    <a href="mailto: hello@yasmine.dev"> hello@yasmine.dev</a>
                </p>
            </div>

    );
