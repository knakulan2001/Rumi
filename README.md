# RUMI Website
According to an ACS Data study, the city of San Francisco is home to the highest
percentage of 18-39 year olds living with roommates. At 28%, the number of young
adults living with roommates in the San Francisco Bay Area exceeds that of any
other city in the United States. Previously, searching for an apartment to rent or
finding a compatible roommate would take countless hours browsing social media
housing groups and unorganized forms online. The city of San Francisco and the
larger surrounding Bay Area has long called for a reliable solution.

This is why our team has built RUMI - the new age digital housing solution
providing a seamless transition into life in the Bay Area. RUMI is a web-based
application helping students and young professionals alike find rooms and rent
apartments around the San Francisco Bay Area. With RUMI, roommates no longer
need to copy/paste their listing specifications countless times in online groups,
discussion forms, and insecure sites online. With RUMI, users can enjoy a uniquely
design experience, while making use of plenty of useful features on the platform
such as the following:
